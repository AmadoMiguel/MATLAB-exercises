This game consists on playing tetris with numbers of the form 2^n, n = 1,2,3,4....The main purpose is to locate adjacent powers of 2 
in order to score. For example, if you locate a 4 on the right side of a 2 (in the same row off coarse) your score will be 6, the 2 
will dissapear and the 4 becomes a 2 (a.k.a matrix will be updated). But if you do the opposite yo get no score. The game finishes either
if you run out of 0s to locate a number in the matrix, or if you reach 1000 points or more. 

Good luck!
